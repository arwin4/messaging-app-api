# Messaging app API

This is a backend implementation of [The Odin Project's full stack _Messaging App_ project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-messaging-app). It is an Express app using MongoDB that manages user creation and authentication, chats, and friends.

As the penultimate project in The Odin Project's curriculum, it showcases a ton of what I've learned during the course. Some of the highlights are listed below.

## Some notable features

- A socket.io server running alongside the API to send live chat updates to clients
- Group chats
- Local user creation and authorization using PassportJS
- Postman tests for all API endpoints
- A bot user that counts messages
- Validation using express-validator
